# HackerRank 30 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my HackerRank 30 Days of Code Challenge repository! This repository contains my solutions to the programming problems from the HackerRank 30 Days of Code Challenge.

## About
HackerRank's 30 Days of Code is a coding challenge aimed at improving coding skills through daily programming problems for 30 consecutive days. Each day presents a new problem statement along with test cases to solve using a programming language of your choice.

## Structure
- Each day's challenge is organized in its own directory (`Day01`, `Day02`, etc.).
- Inside each directory, you'll find:
  - `README.md`: Explanation of the problem statement and approach for my solution.
  - `<language>` folder: Contains the solution code in the chosen programming language.
  - `input.txt` (if applicable): Sample input for the problem.
  - `output.txt` (if applicable): Expected output for the sample input.

## Languages Used
I've solved the problems using the following programming languages:
- Java

Feel free to explore solutions in different languages!

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific day's directory to view the problem statement, solution, input, and output.
3. Run the solution code and compare the output with the provided sample output (if available) to verify correctness.
4. Modify or enhance the solutions as needed.

## Contributions
I'm open to contributions and improvements! If you have an optimized solution or want to add solutions in other languages, feel free to create a pull request.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are personal implementations for the HackerRank challenges and might not be the most optimized or the only correct solutions. They are provided for learning and reference purposes.

Enjoy your journey through HackerRank's 30 Days of Code Challenge!
